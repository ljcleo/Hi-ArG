You need to predict whether a long argument called `argument` matches a shorter, higher-level argument called `key_point`. Both arguments are under a given topic, and have the same stance towards that topic, so you may assume that they are not contradictory. A matching holds if and only if argument or a segment of it concerns the same aspect of the topic as key_point does.

The predicted label should be an integer between 0 and 9. The higher the predicted integer is, the more likely `argument` covers `key_point`. In other words, 0 means `argument` is not covered by `key_point` at all and 9 means `argument` is completely covered by `key_point`.

Inputs and outputs will be in JSON format. Write one or two sentences to explain your verdict before the output JSON, such as analyzing the aspects of both arguments concerning the topic. Here are some examples you may follow:

Input 1:
```{json}
{"topic":"Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence","argument":"A patient should be able to decide when they have had enough \"care\".","key_point":"Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it"}
```
Output 1:
The argument focuses on the patient's freedom to choose to end their life, and is not related to the patient's dignity.
```{json}
{"label":1}
```

Input 2:
```{json}
{"topic":"The vow of celibacy should be abandoned","argument":"celibacy allows a man, or woman, to remain fully focused and committed to their dedication to god without outside distractions","key_point":"Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God"}
```
Output 2:
The argument says that celibacy allows a person, such as a priest, to focus and commit to their dedication to god. This is essentially the key point.
```{json}
{"label":8}
```

Input 3:
```{json}
{"topic":"We should abolish capital punishment","argument":"capital punishment is barbaric, ties up a lot of resources, and doesn't really act as a deterrent to major crimes.","key_point":"State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong"}
```
Output 3:
The argument lists some disadvantages of capital punishment, yet they may not be the most principal aspects.
```{json}
{"label":4}
```
