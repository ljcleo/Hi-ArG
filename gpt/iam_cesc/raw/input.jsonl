{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"It is probably impossible to find a person living in a developed country that would not have heard about reality shows."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"A relatively new genre of entertaining production, reality television quickly gained popularity among all audiences, becoming one of the most demanded-for and lucrative niches in mass media."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"It creates extremely appealing, sometimes even addictive content."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"This would be fine if its audience consisted entirely of adults: grown-up people usually have established behavioral models, shaped outlooks, and tend to view reality TV content as mere entertainment."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"At the same time, a large percentage of viewers are teenagers or even children–and in this case, the worldwide popularity of reality shows may be not so harmless after all."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Although its emergence and development is usually associated with late 1990s and youth-oriented channels such as MTV, the history of reality television goes a little back further in time."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"It all started in the 1970s with the show called “An American Family” released on air (ANVC)."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"A series of documentaries depicting mundane and sometimes dramatic events in the lives of a regular Californian family captivated the minds and hearts of millions of Americans, paving the way for hundreds of the show’s ideological successors."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"The idea of a reality show is somewhat voyeuristic: a group of “real people” allows cameramen, directors, and other TV staff into their homes or other everyday environments, and lets them broadcast their lives on television."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"To make these shows more interactive, producers often initiate all kinds of voting–for example, when the audience decides the fate of the show’s participants via online polls or phone calls."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Rather often, even adult viewers rarely contemplate the possibility that the people they watch are actors, that they follow a script, and that the plot and dynamics of the show often reflects the demands and expectations of the target audience (Screenrant)."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"In the case of teenagers, they tend to see behavioral patterns and relationship models depicted in their favorite shows as exemplary, especially if there are celebrities involved–and this is just one of the numerous problems."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"In particular, reality television often shows excessive amounts of aggression; this is needed mostly to keep the audience “on their toes,” making them guess about the outcomes of numerous fomented interpersonal conflicts."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"For example, shows aimed at female audiences may promote gossiping, condescendence, and bullying as a part of “normal” women’s behavior (The MGH Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds)."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Shows directed for men can do the same, encouraging the usage of aggression or even violence as a mean of solving interpersonal conflicts and\/or relationship problems."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Jealousy, inadequacy, intrigues, gossips, and verbal and emotional abuse are often fake in the case of reality shows, and are meant to attract and thrill audiences."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"However, teenagers may see it as real, adopting and reproducing these behavioral patterns in real life."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"And, considering how much time a regular American teenager spends watching television, this fact is alarming."}

{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"“Sex sells” is a formula too efficient to be neglected in show business."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"A vast amount of television products promote or depict sex one way or another."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Reality shows are no exception from this rule; it is not uncommon to see sexually-suggestive or explicit content in such reality shows as “Ex on the Beach” or “Big Brother.” At the same time, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, teenage girls viewing such reality shows tend to view physical attractiveness and sexual appeal as criteria for success in real life, or even means of reaching it."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"There are also reports proving that teenage girls watching shows with sexual content are more likely to get pregnant at an early age."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Moreover, many shows depict people under the influence of alcohol behaving inadequately."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Some studies assume that teenagers viewing such content may feel like it is safe for them to consume alcohol at a young age, or that they cannot be held accountable for their behaviors when drunk (Livestrong)."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"These two factors combined generate an explosive mixture, adding up to regular teenage hormonal storms: needless to say, it can make unpredictable adolescent behaviors even more rebellious."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"In the case of some reality shows, children and teenagers can be not only viewers, but also participants."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"This is mostly true for all kinds of talent shows focusing on children’s extraordinary talents or abilities."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Although it can be considered relatively harmless and many parents enjoy watching such shows together with their kids, there may be negative psychological effects here as well."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"In particular, according to Arundhati Swamy, a family counselor and parenting expert, such shows may draw parents to a belief that their children must also exceptional and talented in some area."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"It is alright if a child indeed has a talent, and his or her parents do not try to benefit from it."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"However, children who are so far not extraordinary in any way may start experiencing lower self-esteem, comparing themselves to the participants of TV shows."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Or, parents may start putting emotional pressure on their children because of this–and the attempts to adapt to excessively high expectations can have a number of adverse effects on a child (Parent Circle)."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Overall, it can be said that reality shows are not affecting teenagers and children positively."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Whereas adults with shaped outlooks and behavioral patterns often view such shows as entertainment and do not seem to be affected by them significantly, teenagers may adopt inappropriate behavioral patterns seen on television."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Such patterns include aggression and bullying, early sexual activity, and substance use."}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"Therefore, it is advisable that teenagers watch reality shows under their parents’ control, or do not watch them at all."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Animal rights movement"}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The animal rights movement, sometimes called the animal liberation movement, animal personhood, or animal advocacy movement, is a social movement which seeks an end to the rigid moral and legal distinction drawn between human and non-human animals, an end to the status of animals as property, and an end to their use in the research, food, clothing, and entertainment industries."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Terms and factions"}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"All animal liberationists believe that the individual interests of non-human animals deserve recognition and protection, but the movement can be split into two broad camps."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Animal rights advocates, or rights liberationists, believe that these basic interests confer moral rights of some kind on the animals, and\/or ought to confer legal rights on them;[1] see, for example, the work of Tom Regan."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Utilitarian liberationists, on the other hand, do not believe that animals possess moral rights, but argue, on utilitarian grounds — utilitarianism in its simplest form advocating that we base moral decisions on the greatest happiness of the greatest number — that, because animals have the ability to suffer, their suffering must be taken into account in any moral philosophy."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"To exclude animals from that consideration, they argue, is a form of discrimination that they call speciesism; see, for example, the work of Peter Singer [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Despite these differences, the terms animal liberation and animal rights are generally used interchangeably."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Factional division has also been characterized as that between the reformist or mainstream faction and the radical abolitionist and direct action factions."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The mainstream faction is largely professionalized and focuses on soliciting donations and gaining media representation."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"This focus on resource mobilization, sought by means of frame alignment with dominant cultural frames, leads to compromise with targets."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Actors in the reformist movement diagnose the problem as one of nonhuman animal mistreatment, offer a prognosis including welfare reform, and employ action frames that include moral shocks."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"It has been noted that the power of the animal rights movement in the United States is centralized in professionalized nonprofit organizations that prefer moderated goals of welfare reform and tend to be isomorphic [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The abolitionist faction diagnoses the problem as one of nonhuman animal use, offers a prognosis including vegan outreach, and employ action frames including a rational and theoretic focus."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Gary Francione, a leader in abolitionism, formed his approach in response to the traditional movement's focus on policy reform."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Members of the abolitionist faction view policy reform as counterproductive and rely on nonviolent education and moral suasion in their repertoire of contention."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"They see the promotion of veganism as a low-opportunity cost means of creating an antispeciesist culture and posing an economic threat to the animal agriculture industrial complex [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The direct action or militant faction includes in its repertoire of contention property damage, open releases, intimidation, and direct violence."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"With these, they offer a prognosis to the problem of animal use that focuses on changing society through force and fear."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Animal rights actors often reject this faction, pointing to violence as a counterproductive tactic that invites repression (e.g., the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act) and does not economically or politically challenge extant systems [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Smaller factions include groups focused around faith-based animal rights theory and veganarchists, whose approach is characterized by a critique of capitalism on the grounds that it has led to mass nonhuman, human, and environmental exploitation [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Such factionalizing, researchers have pointed out, is common to social movements and plays a role in sustaining their health [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"History"}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The Animal Rights Movement traces back to the animal protection movement in Victorian England, which was initiated by aristocratic moral crusaders in response to the poor treatment of urban workhorses and stray dogs."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Other early influences include: Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle, which drew attention to obscured slaughterhouse operations; Henry Salt's treatises on nonhuman animal rights; which drew from human abolitionist arguments for recognizing personhood of people considered to be property; and the Alcott House of New England, a community serving as a stop on the Underground Railroad and requiring its residents to eat a vegan diet [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The contemporary movement is regarded as having been founded in the UK in the early 1970s by a group of Oxford university post-graduate philosophy students, now known as the Oxford Group [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The group was led by Rosalind and Stanley Godlovitch, graduate students of philosophy who had recently become vegetarians."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The Godlovitches met John Harris and David Wood, also philosophy graduates, who were soon persuaded of the arguments in favour of animal rights and themselves became vegetarian."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The group began to actively raise the issue with pre-eminent Oxford moral philosophers, including Professor Richard Hare, both personally and in lectures."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Their approach was based not on sentimentality (kindness to dumb animals'), but on the moral rights of animals."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"They soon developed (and borrowed) a range of powerful arguments in support of their views, so that Oxford clinical psychologist Richard Ryder, who was shortly to become part of the group, writes that rarely has a cause been so rationally argued and so intellectually well armed [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"It was a 1965 article by novelist Brigid Brophy in The Sunday Times which was pivotal in helping to spark the movement."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Brophy wrote:"}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"“"}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"We employ their work; we eat and wear them."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entrail in the hope—or on the mere offchance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"”"}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The philosophers found this article and were inspired by its vigorous unsentimental polemic."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"At about the same time, Ryder wrote three letters to the Daily Telegraph in response to Brophy's arguments [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Brophy read Ryder's letters and put him in touch with the Godlovitches and John Harris, who had begun to plan a book about the issue which was also partly inspired by Brophy's polemic."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The philosophers had also been to see Brophy about the possibility of a book of essays on the subject [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"They initially thought that a book with contributions from Brophy, Ruth Harrison, Maureen Duffy and other well-known writers might be of interest to publishers, but after an initial proposal was turned down by the first publisher they approached, Giles Gordon of Victor Gollancz suggested that the work would be more viable if it included their own writing."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"This was the idea that became Animals, Men and Morals' (see below)."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"In 1970, Ryder coined the phrase speciesism, first using it in a privately printed pamphlet to describe the assignment of value to the interests of beings on the basis of their membership of a particular species [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Ryder subsequently became a contributor to Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans (1972), edited by John Harris and the Godlovitches, a work that became highly influential [ref], as did Rosalind Godlovitch's essay Animal and Morals, published the same year."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"It was in a review of Animals, Men and Morals for the New York Review of Books that Australian philosopher Peter Singer first put forward his basic arguments, based on utilitarianism and drawing an explicit comparison between women's liberation and animal liberation."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Out of the review came Singer's Animal Liberation, published in 1975, now regarded by many as the bible of the movement."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Other books regarded as important include philosopher Tom Regan's The Case for Animal Rights (1983); Created from Animals: The Moral Implications of Darwinism by James Rachels (1990); Animals, Property, and the Law (1995) by legal scholar Gary Francione, Rattling the Cage: Toward Legal Rights for Animals by another legal scholar Steven M. Wise (2000); and Animal Rights and Moral Philosophy by Julian H. Franklin (2005) [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Gender, class, and other factors"}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Another factor feeding the animal rights movement was revulsion to televised slaughters."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"In the United States, many public protest slaughters were held in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the National Farmers Organization."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Protesting low prices for meat, farmers would kill their own animals in front of media representatives."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The carcasses were wasted and not eaten."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"However, this effort backfired because it angered television audiences to see animals being needlessly and wastefully killed [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The movement predominately comprises upper-class and middle-class white female members, owing this to its associations with the Victorian English animal protection movement and American feminism and environmentalism movements [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"As such, the movement is widely associated in public spheres with women, femininity, and effeminacy."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Public perception of the movement is influenced by gendered evaluations; movement outsiders tend to view activists as irrational by virtue of overly emotional sentiments."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Aware of this, activists have strategically incorporated men into positions of leadership and theory production, in order to legitimate the movement and counter popular beliefs about the primacy of emotion in the animal rights movement."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"This tactic relies on the popular perception of men as rational and not given to emotion, and follows a trend in social movement activism that seeks to counter traditional associations with femininity and private spheres by emphasizing rationality, rights, and justice [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"In one case study, targets of anti-hunting activism used class and gender markers to evaluate activists' claims."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Hunters' associations of irrationality with femininity and of inexperience in hunting and wilderness with white-collar positions constituted the reasons for their dismissal of activists' claims."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"In contrast, hunters framed hunting in logical, scientific, and altruistic terms, thus legitimating hunting, termed wildlife management, as a protective measure [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"It has been noted that the composition of the movement may discourage the mobilization of particular demographics."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"A content analysis of magazine covers from highly visible animal rights organizations (PeTA and VegNews) revealed that most featured members were white, female, and thin."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"With this, and with the composition of the movement being mostly white, female, and thin, it has been suggested that animal rights media depict an activist ideal-type with such characteristics, and that this may mobilize thin white females while deterring others."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Racialized, sexualized, and size-focused campaign tactics may also serve to deter potential members from joining the movement."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Racialized tactics include the appropriation of African slavery and Holocaust language and imagery, and have been deemed insensitive and impugned by nonwhite communities."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"In addition, the movement has maintained racist stereotypes about nonwhite individuals' predisposition toward animal cruelty; these stereotypes arose in post-slavery U.S. and Britain, where nonwhites were deemed by law and by society to have a tendency toward animal cruelty."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Sexualization of ideal women is used as a mobilization tactic, but reduces support for ethics-based campaigns and may be counterproductive, alienating women that do not have ideal body types."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Sizeism is used as a tactic to frame veganism as a healthy and positive lifestyle, aligning with a popular association of fatness with moral failure."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"These tactics may contribute to gender inequality because unrealistic and sexualized representations of women are linked to their societal devaluation."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Its lack of diverse membership may decrease the movement's legitimacy and ability to mobilize, as members of marginalized groups are more likely to mobilize when they are represented in the movement."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"An inclusive movement with strong group solidarity would decrease opportunity costs associated with participating (e.g., social stigmatization, lack of alternatives, legal persecution) and thus serve to increase and sustain participation in the movement [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Current status of the movement"}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"The movement is no longer viewed as hovering on the fringe [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"In the 1980s and 1990s, it was joined by a wide variety of academics and professionals, including lawyers, physicians, psychologists, veterinarians, and former vivisectionists [ref], and is now a common subject of study in philosophy departments in Europe and North America [ref]."}
{"topic":"Should we support animal rights","candidate":"Animal law courses are taught in 92 out of 180 law schools in the U.S [ref]., and the movement has gained the support of senior legal scholars, including Alan Dershowitz[22] and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School [ref]."}

{"topic":"Shouldn't online gambling be banned","candidate":"Since the hard, cold facts about the inevitable failure ofprohibition will undoubtedly depress some decent andwell-intentioned people, I will leaven my analysis with somecomforting words about Internet gambling."}

{"topic":"Shouldn't online gambling be banned","candidate":"Some proponents of a ban on Internet gambling argue thatif prohibition will not work then neither will any scheme ofregulation."}
{"topic":"Shouldn't online gambling be banned","candidate":"(1)Such anargument fundamentally misunderstands a basic principle ofgovernance, however: Regulations can succeed evenwhere prohibition fails if they offer benefits that exceed theirburdens."}

{"topic":"Shouldn't online gambling be banned","candidate":"Each Internet message getsbroken into discrete packets, which travel over various andunpredictable routes until received and reassembled at themessage's destination."}
{"topic":"Shouldn't online gambling be banned","candidate":"In other words, sending a message over theInternet is a bit like corresponding with someone by writing aletter, chopping it up, and mailing each piece separately to thesame address."}

{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"Riddled with the usual uncertainties of science, it seemed pretty certain of one thing: Doing it without biofuels would be much harder."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"Absent a big increase in bioenergy supplies, the climate change panel’s analysis reported, it would cost about two-thirds more, on average, to prevent the earth’s temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, generally considered the tipping point for climatic upheaval."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"The availability of biofuels makes more difference to the ultimate price tag, the panel concluded, than whether electricity generation can be harnessed successfully to the sun and wind."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"Only carbon capture and storage technology is more important."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"In most of the climate change panel’s models that bring temperatures back under the 2-degree ceiling by the end of the century, biofuels are assumed to produce about 250 to 350 exajoules of energy a year."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"To put that in context, 300 exajoules is over half the world’s current energy consumption."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"Today, the energy content of all the biomass harvested for food, fodder and everything else amounts to about 220 exajoules."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"The question is, Where will the land to produce all this additional vegetation come from?"}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"As a committee of the European Environmental Agency noted, to reduce the amount of CO2 in the air, bioenergy production “must increase the total amount of plant growth, making more plants available for energy use while preserving other benefits.”"}

{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"The rest could come from better harvesting of forests and the use of organic waste."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"In a recent research article, Professor Faaij and colleagues calculated that it would be technically possible to get about 100 exajoules by 2050 from what they call “surplus forest growth,” meaning the bits of forest that are neither protected nor already exploited for wood, and wood waste."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"This sort of calculation drives Mr. Searchinger up the wall."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"“Surplus forest growth” he said, is already pulling CO2 from the air."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"Harvesting it for energy will provide no further benefit for climate change."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"The same could be said of idled agricultural land, where forest usually starts regrowing soon, capturing carbon from the air."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"“In many contexts, allowing a forest to grow will do more to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for decades than producing bioenergy,” he told me."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"And he finds the estimates of future agricultural productivity unbelievable when applied to any reasonable understanding of the real world."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"Indeed, it will be hard to maintain the productivity growth of the last several decades, he says, let alone substantially increase it."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"“Because the world needs to produce 70 percent more of virtually all the products of land — crops, grasses and wood — by 2050, there is no additional room for bioenergy, and any capacity to increase crop yields and to make better use of any underutilized land is already needed for these other purposes,” Mr. Searchinger said."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"Professor Faaij says the skeptics are wrong, arguing that the alternatives to a huge increase in biofuel production would be even more difficult to achieve."}
{"topic":"Should you subsidize biofuels","candidate":"But it could be possible to produce the zero-carbon energy the world will need without incurring such steep opportunity costs."}

{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"And, of course, the regulatory outcome does not, necessarily, represent a jurisdictional consensus on the central ethical issues."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"Lawyers rarely look to regulatory outcome to understand ethical debates."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"Unfortunately, in the area of cloning many commentators do that very thing."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"As our starting quotation demonstrates, politicians and commentators are all too ready to find support for their ethical views in regulatory positions adopted elsewhere."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"There are, however, varying levels of ethical agreement."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"Agreement on the appropriate regulatory position does not imply agreement on the underlying ethical principles."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"Consider the relationship between ethical positions on the moral status (or dignity) of the cloned embryo and NRC."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"The cloned embryo could be considered to have full, no, or limited moral status [18, 35]."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"The full status position would grant the embryo the same level of moral duties as you or I."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"The no status position would grant the embryo no more status or dignity than your hair or nails."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"The limited status position would grant the embryo a fixed or gradualist level of intrinsic moral value between these two extremes."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"The full status position will require the prohibition of NRC (destructive use of embryos is considered murder) and the no status position will usually require NRC to be permitted (unless such an approach will interfere with the moral interests of those who do matter)."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"The limited status position is, however, potentially compatible with either regulatory position, depending on the particular status given to the early embryo and the weight given to potential benefits of NRC."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"It follows that the fact that the regulatory position permits or prohibits NRC does not do even tell us what status the embryo is considered to have."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"This is further complicated by the fact that supporters of the no or limited status position might be prepared to accept more restrictions than are strictly required by their position to protect a more important moral goal."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"Only supporters of the full status position cannot coherently make such pragmatic compromises [18]."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"Similarly, the existing positions on RC could be supported by radically different ethical views."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"Prohibitions could be supported by those who hold that RC is absolutely wrong (eg always violates human dignity) and by those who hold that cloning at present would be wrong."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"Even time-limited prohibition does not enable us to discern whether it is underpinned by, for example, the view that RC is wrong because of current safety issues or the view that RC is not wrong but the most effective way to get there is by initially prohibiting it."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"In sum, the majority of regulatory outcomes could be coherently explained by reference to one or more underlying ethical positions."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"Thus, similar or even identical regulatory outcomes imply less by way of ethical agreement than some may be inclined to believe."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"Cloning laws and policies are far from uniform across the globe and the legal position in some countries remains uncertain."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"This will give little comfort to scientists and policy makers hoping to gain clear direction from the international position."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"For the time being at least, policymakers must accept the reality of international dissensus and scientists wishing to undertaken research on NRC are best advised to consider conducting their research in only a handful of countries."}
{"topic":"Should we ban human cloning","candidate":"Even where there is agreement as to the regulatory outcome, policy-makers should not confuse this with agreement on underlying ethical principles."}
