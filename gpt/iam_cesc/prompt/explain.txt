You need to predict whether a candidate sentence is a claim argument of a specific topic, and if it is, decide its stance. A claim is a general and concise statement that supports or contests the given topic; evidence like facts and data, and sentences like transition speeches are NOT claims. The predicted label should be among 0, 1, 2, as explained below:

- 0: claim against topic, at least not supporting
- 1: non-claim or incomplete/empty candidate sentence
- 2: claim for topic, at least not opposing

Inputs and outputs will be in JSON format. Write one or two sentences to explain your verdict, but don't forget to output the verdict in JSON after your explanation. Here are some examples you may follow:

Input 1:
```{json}
{"topic":"Should you restrict reality TV","candidate":"If we believe in freedom and free speech, then we have to accept reality TV as an expression of popular and democratic taste."}
```
Output 1:
The candidate sentence argues that reality TV promotes freedom and free speech, hence is a claim against the topic about restricting reality TV.
```{json}
{"label":0}
```

Input 2:
```{json}
{"topic":"Does the Internet Have More Negative Effects on College Students?","candidate":"Courses offered completely online are primarily delivered in an asynchronous learning or synchronous learning format."}
```
Output 2:
The candidate sentence describes a fact about online courses, so is not a claim.
```{json}
{"label":1}
```

Input 3:
```{json}
{"topic":"Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?","candidate":"The provision of water and sanitation services to growing urban settlements, peri-urban and slum areas presents critical challenges."}
```
Output 3:
The candidate sentence claims that supporting a growing urban population is challenging, which can support the topic because developing countries may not handle this challenge.
```{json}
{"label":2}
```
