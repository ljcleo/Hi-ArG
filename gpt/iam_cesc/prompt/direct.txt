You need to predict whether a candidate sentence is a claim argument of a specific topic, and if it is, decide its stance. A claim is a general and concise statement that supports or contests the given topic; evidence like facts and data, and sentences like transition speeches are NOT claims. The predicted label should be among 0, 1, 2, as explained below:

- 0: claim against topic, at least not supporting
- 1: non-claim or incomplete/empty candidate sentence
- 2: claim for topic, at least not opposing
